If you want to know why I created this website, it is quite clear from the bottom of the page :D. I really do not know what to add on the home page... I initially was thinking about writing about my self, but that is probably better suited in the `about` section :p. 

I guess I'll use this page to welcome my readers :

If you want to see some cool projects I've worked on, you can check out my Github [here](https://github.com/Edward2k). The vast majority of my repos are private as they did stem from projects I complted for my (ongoing) bachelor. I can't make those public for obvious plagerism issues future students may face if they read my code :p.
