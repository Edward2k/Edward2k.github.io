About 3 weeks ago, I moved into my first place away from home: Amsterdam. I live with 5 other people in a house that is about 20 minutes away from school. 

As a self-sufficient student, money is a little tight. The house, when observed closely, refelects that financial status. All of us (us == housemates) have put in a lot of effort to re-maintain the house by ridding mold, thoroughly cleaning all the areas, new furniture, a little painting, gardening etc. The house has actually come together quite nicely. We did however, notice a few mice a few days ago. Hugh (the alias to one of my housemates), went to the pet store and bought some mouse traps. We set them up in areas where we found mouse feeces. All we had to do was wait. 

One day passed...

Two days passed...

Three days passed...

<h6><strong>We caught two mice in one night!</strong></h6>

That exclamation carries both joy and dispair... While we did catch more mice than we initially thought were in the house, it means that there are more mice in the house than we initially thought.
