Many people (especially students like myself) may wonder, how difficult is it to get a job in programming as a student? I can't answer that.

I, as a student of Computer Science, take pride in the software I create. Part of this pride stems from what I've learnt with all my projects. However, it is trivial that programmers do not work in isolation. It is precisely this collaborative work on software projects that I would like to experience and learn from.

Every person has their own ideas, every person has their own tendencies and every person has their own opinions. How can it be, despite these differences, programmers can write millions of lines of code that seem to work in perfect harmony? How do you even approach that level of collaboration? Sure, I've learnt about interfacing and the importance of documentation, but surely there is more to that story. And while I have never written code with more than 2 people at a time, I wish I could learn (in a practical manner), how to work in this hyper-cooperative environment.
